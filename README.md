# Rusty bird

This project is just for fun to learn rust devlopment. I will try to implement a cheap version into a cli game with some useless features

## Installation

To run the project you just need to have `cargo` and `rustup` install and run: `cargo run`

In some future I'll try to use docker just to see how the input between docker and computer can work if it is possible.
